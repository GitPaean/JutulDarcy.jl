It is also possible to read cases that have been set up in MRST (see [`setup_case_from_mrst`](@ref) and [`simulate_mrst_case`](@ref)) or from .DATA files (see [`parse_data_file`](@ref) and [`simulate_data_file`](@ref))
## MAT-files from the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST)

## DATA-files from commercial reservoir modelling software
